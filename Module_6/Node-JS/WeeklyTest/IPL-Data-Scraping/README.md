## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Ash-dot-coder/Geekster_Task]
cd Module_6\Node-JS\WeeklyTest\IPL-Data-Scraping
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> Puppeteer will automatically install Chromium. Ensure you have a stable connection.

### 3. Run the Scraper

```bash
node index.js
```

✅ This will scrape the data and output `.json` files like `processedData1.json` in your project root.

## 📈 View the Dashboard

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the player stats visualized using Chart.js.

You can enhance it with dynamic features like dropdown filters, animations, or season-wise toggles.

```
node_modules/
```

You may also want to add `.json` files if you don’t want to push scraped data to your repo:

```
*.json
!package.json
!package-lock.json
```
